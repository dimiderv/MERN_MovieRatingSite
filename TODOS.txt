Things I have to do.

Ideas/Improvements

*Add small announcement if I added to favorites (ex. "Just added to favorites")
*Should I keep track of what each user likes? How?
*Focusable buttons, cards, etc. (gave it a short try but couldn't make it work)
*Users can upload their profile picture

Must do:
* Make the navigation bar disappear when token has expired. (See bug no 1)
* Favorites should be able to undo from their favorites. 
* Make a frontpage. 
* Favorites button doesn't work on home page!

Not so important:
*Register needs fixing (I changed some data that the user needs)
*Birthday currently is a string should be a Date.
*Make favorites and intro page have same layout (/home since its carousel they are spaced out evenly cover more space)


Progress
8/01/24
*Solved the styling issue by using React.Portal to style a child independently from its parent. (Should troubleshoot to be sure about functionality of it)
*Deleted React.Portal and used ToastContext to render a new component completely. Stacks messages correctly but can't delete them.

7/01/24
*Looks like whatever is inside the MultiCarousel component cant render outside of it.
* I should change Structure of my Components if I want to use MultiCarousel
6/01/24
*Should make toast message appear after api call.

5/01/24
*Toasted message works. Disabled animation of Toasted message so that it doesn't trigger the findDOMNode.

4/01/24
*Checking for improvements

3/01/24
*might add localState to disable NavigationBar

*Checked routing and persist login to understand re-routing and redirecting when not persisting login.(Used debug on Chrome dev tool, and checked Sources)
*Found logout bug! Redirects 2 times once when auth is deleted cause of the RequiredAuth component.


2/01/24
*Updated branches.


1/01/24
*Added separate state for each movie icon.
*Cleaned some components that I don't use.



Bugs

1. When I don't persist login, if I leave page navigation bar can be used to still have access to data. If it's on my PC it's fine but on another PC that is not good. Also ,Navigation bar appears with Login component.
